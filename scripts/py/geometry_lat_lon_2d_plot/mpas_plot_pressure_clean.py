This python file provides an example of plotting an MPAS field onto an MPAS
mesh. This plot produces pcolor like plots by created a collection of polygons
(MatPltLib patches) of the MPAS mesh. Thus, for large meshes this routine is
very slower.

However, this file has been provided with the `mpas_patches.py` which provides
a function `get_mpas_patches` that will autmoatcially produce such polygons as
a 'patch collection'. For large meshes, producing the patch collection is
costly and timely so `get_mpas_patches` will produce a python 'pickle' file, so
that it will only need to be produced once. This will greatly speed up the time
it takes to on subsequent visualiations.

Note: This 'clean' version of this example contains less comments and documentation,
but is the same as mpas_plot_pressure.py.

This file was created with great help and reference from:
